To interact with the ball, you touch the ball on the screen. The ball with move in relation to not only where it is touched on it surface, but also where the user is in relation to the ball. For example if you touck the right side of the ball while directly in front of it, the ball will react with a right rotation that will make it most likely move forward and to the right from its postion. If the user is looking directly down on the ball and touches the right side of the ball, the ball will react with a right rotation that will make it move to the right of its position in a straight line.
